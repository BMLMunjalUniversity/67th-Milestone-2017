But the elements of incest, greed and corruption in this story underpins social realism.\r\nIt revolves around two families of Lahore and what happened to them after independence, or, more correctly, after the partition. One of the family consists of a lady, Amrita, from fine old family, hey daughter, Ansuya, and her younger brother, Karan Chand. They came to Delhi after her husband died in the riots, where there had a couple of mills and properties. But losses mounted as they were now not able to manage those and later they had to sell everything and so moved to 9 Jakhoo hill, once their vacation residence. As Chitra, daughter of once a domestic help to Amrita's family, is visiting 9 jakhoo hill with her son, Deepak, who is doing exceptionally great in his career. But later we realize that it isn't the friendship which has brought her to 9 Jakhoo Hill, but her greed. She just wants success for her son, and can even go to any extent for that. Again her objective behind this visit is to obtain license for her son's benefit from Rai Saheb, who is a government officer and a close friend of Amrita. Now as everyone assembles at 9 Jakhoo Hill to celebrate diwali, the story becomes more surreal and intriguing when the game of truth and dare starts. As love, laughter, loneliness and betrayal come face to face in this drama, a moment of truth compels each character to reckon with his\/her personal demons and transforms their lives irrevocably."}
